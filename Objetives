# Objetives
General Objective
To develop an intelligent air quality monitoring system for controlled environments. 
Specific objective: Develop the electronic circuitry and design the PCB to ensure accurate measurement of key air quality parameters in the first working prototype.
Specific objective: Evaluate the power consumption of the system, perform tests to capture air quality data and display it on a graphical interface. 
Specific objective: Implement the prototype on PCB and the predictive model to forecast future parameters.
